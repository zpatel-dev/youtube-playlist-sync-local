"""Planning and applying the Plex layout.

The only module that moves the user's files. Nothing is ever deleted — a losing
duplicate is parked in `LIBRARY_ROOT/.duplicates/` and every move records
`previous_path`. Nothing is written outside `LIBRARY_ROOT`: every destination is
checked with `is_within` first, because destinations are computed from tag data
that came off the internet and an artist name with `../..` only has to work once.

Every write uses `save(update_fields=[...])` or a queryset `update()`, because a
bare `save()` on a row a concurrent job deleted silently re-INSERTs it; every
file operation runs under that track's key lock. Path computation is in
`music/plex.py`.
