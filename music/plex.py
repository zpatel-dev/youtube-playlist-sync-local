    Music/Artist/Album/TrackNumber - TrackName.ext
    Music/Various Artists/Album/TrackNumber - TrackName.ext

Multi-disc albums prepend the disc number, so disc 3 track 2 becomes `302 - …`.
The disc number is prepended only when it is 2 or higher: a single-disc rip
that happens to tag `disc=1` would otherwise become `101 - …` rather than
`01 - …`. Plex reads the disc number from the embedded tag regardless, so the
filename convention is the secondary signal here, not the authority.
