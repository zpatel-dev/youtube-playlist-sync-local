"""
The web layer: one dashboard, three htmx fragments, one SSE stream, and a set of
POST actions that do nothing but enqueue a job.

Three rules run through everything here, each one an audit finding:

**Views never do slow work** (A2, A6). Every action enqueues a `Job` and returns
204 with an `HX-Trigger` toast. A view that shells out, downloads or hashes is a
view that pins a gunicorn thread; the request pool on the Pi is four threads.

**The SSE stream costs nothing while idle** (A2). It waits on the in-process
condition variable in `core.events` — no query per tick, no cost per connected
tab — and closes itself after `SSE_MAX_STREAM_SECONDS` so threads always
recycle. The browser reconnects on its own via the `retry:` directive.

**Every query names its columns.** `.only()` / `.values()` everywhere, because a
`SELECT *` over a 20k-row library on a Pi 2's SD card is a visible pause. The
`.only()` lists below must stay in step with what the templates render — a
deferred field touched in a template costs one extra query *per row*.

Toast text reaches the browser through `HX-Trigger`; see `static/music/app.js`
for the `textContent` build that closes the stored-XSS hole (A11).
